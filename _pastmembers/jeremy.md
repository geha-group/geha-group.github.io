    Jeremy Bradford completed his Ph.D. in the Astronomy department at Yale and obtained his B.S. in Mathematics and Physics from Central Connecticut State University in 2012. As part of the Geha Group, he was interested in the dark matter content, the evolution and the dynamics of galaxies. His research involved multi-wavelength observations of isolated low mass galaxies. He was interested in testing Lambda-CDM cosmology using isolated galaxies in order to minimize the complex physics involved in modeling galaxy-galaxy interactions. Jeremy is from Connecticut.
