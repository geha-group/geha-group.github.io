    Luis completed his Ph.D. in the Astronomy department at Yale and his B.S in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Kansas. Years before that, he was born and raised in Lima, Peru. As part of the Geha Group, Luis was interested in everything related to the Milky Way and the Local Group, but studied the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Milky Way system using chemical abundances of their constituent stars. He was also involved in research projects focusing on chemical abundances in the Milky Way halo, and Andromeda.
