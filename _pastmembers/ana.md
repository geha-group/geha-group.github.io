    Ana completed her Ph.D. in the Astronomy department at Yale and her M.S. in Physics from University of Zagreb. Ana worked in the Geha Group on tidal streams, and her first year project in the Geha group resulted in a discovery of a stellar tidal stream in the Milky Way halo. She also analyzed simulated streams to discover the link between their 6D phase space distribution and the underlying gravitational potential. Ana is originally from Croatia.
