We present the largest self-consistent sample of spectroscopically-derived quantities for 
Milky Way satellite galaxies and globular clusters based on a homogeneous re-analysis of 
individual stars observed with the Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph.   We determine uniform internal 
velocity dispersions, enclosed dynamical masses, mean [Fe/H] metalliticies, and internal 
metallicity spreads for systems with 10 or more member stars.
