We present a homogeneous spectroscopic dataset of 22,339 stars in 78 Milky Way dwarf galaxy satellites and globular clusters. 
All data were taken with the Keck II telescope and Deep Extragalactic
Imaging Multiobject Spectrograph (DEIMOS) spectrograph using the 1200G grating. 
Based on a uniform data reduction of 411 DEIMOS masks, we present a catalog of
individual stellar radial velocities, equivalent width-based [Fe/H] metallicities, 
and membership estimates. 

You can access the database here: 
- <a href="{{ '/assets/deimos/table1.csv' | relative_url }}" download>Table 1</a> lists the Milky Way system names (e.g., Draco, NGC 4590), literature properties, and select measured system quantities (78 rows).
- <a href="{{ '/assets/deimos/table2.csv' | relative_url }}" download>Table 2</a> lists observational details for each DEIMOS mask included in this work (411 rows). There are five additional rows in this table for overlapping masks in the Sgr and NGC6715 systems.
- <a href="{{ '/assets/deimos/table3.csv' | relative_url }}" download>Table 3</a> is the primary data table, one row per unique star observed with DEIMOS. Measurements include velocity, CaT-based metallicity and membership estimates (22,339 rows).
- <a href="{{ '/assets/deimos/table4.csv' | relative_url }}" download>Table 4</a> lists identified extragalactic sources with measured redshifts (2,097 rows).
- <a href="{{ '/assets/deimos/table5.csv' | relative_url }}" download>Table 5</a>  lists the schema for an expanded table of measurements for objects from both Tables 3 and 4 (24,436 rows).
