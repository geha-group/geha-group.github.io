    The Astro-RPS workshop series covers an introduction to the Python programming language in the context of physics and astrophysics applications. This graduate-student led series is primarily intended for undergraduate students with little to no exposure to coding, and designed to teach the fundamental skills neccessary for astronomy research.

Astro-RPS is a graduate-student led workshop series designed for students with little to no exposure to coding or astronomy research with the goal of providing an introduction to the Python programming language in the context of physics and astrophysics applications. All research carried in these scientific fields requires the use of extensive programming, making it a bedrock skill of any scientist. In this series, we start from square one, covering how to install and navigate the programming ecosystem such as the terminal/shell, before moving into how to create scientific programs in python to carry out calculations one might use in a research project. After taking this series, students should be prepared to tackle programming-based courses (e.g., ASTR 255/330) as well as feel comfortable applying to summer research positions.

All of the course materials developed for Astro-RPS are publicly available at [this website](https://astro-rps.github.io/).
