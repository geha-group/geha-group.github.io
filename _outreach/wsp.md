The Warrior-Scholar Project (WSP) is a non-profit organization empowering enlisted veterans and transitioning service members to succeed in higher education.  WSP was founded at Yale in 2012 by several undergraduate students and recent alumni.  WSP’s main program activity is running one- and two-week academic bootcamps led by enlisted veterans who have already successfully transitioned into college, in collaboration with professors and graduate students from each host institution.    Prof Geha serves on WSP's Board of Directors and many Geha group students and postdocs have taught during a WSP bootcamp.   

WPS is free of charge to student veterans, more information <a href="https://www.warrior-scholar.org/">can be found here</a>
