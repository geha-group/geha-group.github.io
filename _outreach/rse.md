This is a free online class created by Prof Geha as an intuitive introduction to rocket science.  Modern life increasingly depends on technology provided by Earth-orbiting satellites, from detailed weather predictions to broad-band internet and GPS. How are satellites launched into orbit and how do they work once they get there? Why are rockets used to get into orbit and how are they different from airplanes? The material is aimed at a wide non-technical audience.
