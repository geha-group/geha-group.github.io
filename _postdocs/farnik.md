    Farnik received his Ph.D. in Physics and Astronomy from the University of Pennsylvania, along with a dual Masterâ€™s degree in Statistics from the Wharton School. While at Penn, he was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow (NSF GRFP). Farnik's research centers on ideas that address the observable effects of both dark energy and dark matter. From the theoretical side, he is interested in Optimal Transport Theory and the fundamental connections this theory has with the physical questions from galactic to cosmological scales. Prior to Penn, Farnik completed my B.Sc. in Physics (minor in Computer Science) at Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.
