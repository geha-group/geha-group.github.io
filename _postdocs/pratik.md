    Pratik is a galaxy theorist working on physics-rich simulations of low-mass galaxies with the FIRE collaboration. He is interested in Local Group galaxies, studying stellar feedback processes and their influence on galaxy formation, and using the archaeological record of present-day low-mass galaxies to probe conditions in the early Universe, including the physics of the first generation ("popIII") stars. Pratik received his Ph.D. from UC Davis in Andrew Wetzel's group. Prior to UC Davis, he grew up in Mumbai, India, and moved to the US for his Bachelor's degree at Yale.
