    The SAGA Survey is a spectroscopic survey designed to better understand our Milky Way Galaxy by placing its satellite galaxy population into a broader cosmological context. The SAGA Survey goal is to measure the distribution of satellite galaxies around 100 Milky Way analogs well below the luminosity where predictions and observations diverge.
